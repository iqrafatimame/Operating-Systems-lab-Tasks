# Operating Systems lab Tasks
- ## Banker's Algorithm 
  Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidence algorithm. Whenever a new process is created, it must specify the maximum instances of each resource type that it needs.
- ## FCFS Algorithm
  FCFS(First Come First Serve) is an operating system scheduling algorithm that automatically executes queued requests and processes in order of their arrival.
- ## First Fit Algorithm
  In First Fit algorithm, the pointer keeps track of all the free blocks in the memory and accepts the request of allocating a memory block to the coming process.
- ## Priority Scheduling Algorithm
  In Priority scheduling algorithm, each process is assigned a priority. Process with highest priority is to be executed first and so on. Processes with same priority are executed on first come first served basis.
- ## Round Robin Algorithm 
  In round robin algorithm, time slicesare assigned to each process in equal portions and in circular order, handling all processes without priority.
- ## Shortest Job First Algorithm
  Shortest Job First is an algorithm in which the process having the smallest execution time is chosen for the next execution.
